# Exp-10: Implementation of K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the K Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
 Step 1: Start

 Step 2: Data Preparation: Load and explore customer data.
 
 Step 3: Determine Optimal Clusters: Use the Elbow Method to find the best number of clusters.
 
 Step 4: Apply K Means Clustering: Perform clustering on customer data.
 
 Step 5: Visualize Segmented Customers: Plot clustered data to visualize customer segments.
 
 Step 6: End
## Program:
